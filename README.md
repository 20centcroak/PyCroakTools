# pycroaktools
pycroaktools package contain convenient modules to adress different needs:
- search for files thanks to regex, including in os folders, ftp locations and zip file with [pycroaktools.files](pycroaktools/files/README.md)
- define a workflow (directed graph) thanks to a simple csv definition with [pycroaktools.workflow](pycroaktools/workflow/README.md)
- automate the [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/#/) presentation creation with [pycroaktools.presentation](pycroaktools/presentation/README.md)
- still simplify [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/#/) presentation creation and create workflow presentation by linking both the presentation and the workflow modules with [pycroaktools.easyPresentation](pycroaktools/easyPresentation/README.md)
